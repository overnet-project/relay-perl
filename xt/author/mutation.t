# Mutation testing with Devel::Mutator. This is the expensive counterpart to the
# coverage gate: coverage asks "did a test execute this line?", mutation asks
# "would a test NOTICE if this line were wrong?". It works by rewriting the
# target modules one small change at a time (== to !=, || to //, and so on) and
# rerunning the suite against each mutant; a mutant that the suite still passes
# is a "survivor" -- code whose behaviour no assertion actually pins down.
#
# It reruns the whole selected suite once per mutant, so it is far too slow for
# a normal author-test pass and is disabled by default. Run it manually, scoped
# to the high-value modules you care about, e.g.:
#
#   OVERNET_MUTATION=1 \
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_FILES=lib/Overnet/Authority/Delegation.pm \
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_TEST_COMMAND='prove -Ilib t/authority-delegation.t' \
#   perl -Ilib xt/author/mutation.t
#
# Devel::Mutator's operator set is narrow (~14 swaps), so treat a clean run as
# "these tests survived a narrow mutation set", not proof of a strong suite.
#
# Equivalent mutants (a change with no observable effect) survive but are not
# real gaps. Rather than a blunt tolerated-count, reviewed survivors are pinned
# individually in an allowlist file (default xt/author/mutation-allow.txt): each
# entry is the changed (-/+) diff lines of a survivor a human has judged
# equivalent or intentional. A survivor that matches an allowlist entry is
# accepted; any *unreviewed* survivor still fails the gate, so a new real gap is
# never hidden by an accepted equivalent. On failure the gate prints each
# unreviewed survivor in exactly the format the allowlist expects, ready to
# paste in after review.
#
# Knobs (all optional except the two above):
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_FILES          colon/space separated lib/ modules to mutate
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_TEST_COMMAND   suite to run per mutant (default: prove -Ilib t)
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_TIMEOUT        per-mutant seconds before "inconclusive" (default 120)
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_MAX_SURVIVORS  tolerated UNREVIEWED survivors (default 0)
#   OVERNET_MUTATION_ALLOW          allowlist path (default xt/author/mutation-allow.txt)
